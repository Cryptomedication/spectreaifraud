<p>Your Telegram History with Spectre [@spectremanagement]</p>
<p>15.07.2018 01:13:29, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Hey<br>
15.07.2018 01:13:37, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Could I ask a couple questions?<br>
15.07.2018 01:13:52, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Hi there, yes sure<br>
15.07.2018 01:14:13, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Hey so apologies in advance if this is common knowledge or you already answered before<br>
15.07.2018 01:14:35, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: But what happened to Spectre? Price wise. Someone commissioned me to write an article on this project<br>
15.07.2018 01:14:56, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: The idea seems good. Website looks clean. Can’t see any signs of any bad press<br>
15.07.2018 01:15:33, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Sure, so we just surpassed our Q1 guidance by 300%<br>
15.07.2018 01:15:34, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: [[Webpage]]<a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/thought-leadership/spectre-ai-exceeds-q1-projections-eying-strong-forward-growth/">https://www.financemagnates.com/thought-leadership/spectre-ai-exceeds-q1-projections-eying-strong-forward-growth/</a><br>
15.07.2018 01:15:50, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Have paid out over 400 ETH in weekly dividends with 200 ETH pending as end of year special divs<br>
15.07.2018 01:15:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: So far have met all roadmap targets on time<br>
15.07.2018 01:16:07, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: our dividend token’s price is around 20% above ICO level despite poor markets<br>
15.07.2018 01:16:19, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: and utility token is around 20% below<br>
15.07.2018 01:16:27, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Yeah I guess I shouldn’t say price. You’re right. It’s outperforming the markets<br>
15.07.2018 01:16:33, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: What I meant to say was <strong>volume</strong><br>
15.07.2018 01:18:18, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: The trading volumes of the tokens are low as we are on smallelr exchanges.<br>
15.07.2018 01:18:30, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are building our own exchange so people can safely trade both tokens, should be out in a few weeks<br>
15.07.2018 01:18:33, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: (regulated, KYC)<br>
15.07.2018 01:18:40, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Yeah but it went from $14M to $2,000<br>
15.07.2018 01:19:05, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Did something happen specifically? Because there isn’t enough liquidity for trade really.<br>
15.07.2018 01:19:11, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I like the premise of the project though<br>
15.07.2018 01:19:38, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Nothing has happened business wise. You can go through the above update to understand more about the project or watch this<br>
15.07.2018 01:19:47, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m not against Spectre<br>
15.07.2018 01:19:47, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: [[Webpage]]<a href="https://youtu.be/yzBL-e1MRtE">https://youtu.be/yzBL-e1MRtE</a><br>
15.07.2018 01:19:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Apologies if it sounds antagonistic<br>
15.07.2018 01:20:08, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m just genuinely curious. Because this sounds good. I’d like this to win.<br>
15.07.2018 01:20:17, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Sure, all understood.<br>
15.07.2018 01:20:25, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: May i suggest you watch the above update to find out what it is we do?<br>
15.07.2018 01:20:36, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We pay dividends weekly and are meeting all our roadmap targets.<br>
15.07.2018 01:20:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: 100%. Your project is awesome. I know about you all haha<br>
15.07.2018 01:21:16, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: But I’m just wondering what made the volume drop off so much in such a short period.<br>
15.07.2018 01:21:18, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: In terms of low trading volumes of the actual token, you can speak to token holders in the main chat, they are not willing to sell something that is paying dividends. So this could explain the low trading volumes along with the fact that we are not on big exchanges.<br>
15.07.2018 01:21:29, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Makes sense<br>
15.07.2018 01:21:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Are you referring to sxut or sxdt?<br>
15.07.2018 01:21:50, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Both. Although the dividends token is killing it<br>
15.07.2018 01:21:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Ok noted<br>
15.07.2018 01:22:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Like in a good way lol<br>
15.07.2018 01:22:28, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Comparatively. Listen, I have a fairly big platform and I want to give Spectre a fair shake<br>
15.07.2018 01:23:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: The article will be as thorough as I can make it &amp; I’ll try my best to show Spectre in a positive light. But $2,000 in 24H volume is so low that it can’t be traded<br>
15.07.2018 01:24:21, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Hi<br>
15.07.2018 01:24:33, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Hey lol<br>
15.07.2018 01:24:34, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I understand what you mean. Also we appreicate you taking the time to look into us.<br>
15.07.2018 01:24:57, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I guess if the volumes atm are too low all we can do is wait till our own exchange is live and we bring volumes up there for sxdt/sxut. Perhaps we can re-engage there?<br>
15.07.2018 01:25:30, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: That makes sense. Is there a reason you guys aren’t listed on any of the centralized exchanges like Binance, Trex, etc?<br>
15.07.2018 01:25:38, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Is that a team decision or?..<br>
15.07.2018 01:25:41, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yes<br>
15.07.2018 01:25:55, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We have a very different view to what is happening at those exchanges and where they will be 2-3 years from now.<br>
15.07.2018 01:26:14, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Secondary reason, we’re not going to pay x4 the listing fee of NASDAQ to get on one of those.<br>
15.07.2018 01:26:34, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Interesting. I respect it though. What is this different view you speak of?<br>
15.07.2018 01:26:45, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: In regards to the exchanges and where they will be 2-3 years from now<br>
15.07.2018 01:27:14, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Poor quality management teams, llittle regard for shifting regulatory landscapes, little regard for AML/KYC and some of the above until recently didnt even have a business address but felt it ok to charge $1-2m + lambos for listing.<br>
15.07.2018 01:27:35, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We spend our money on building our product and outperformring targets; that drives token holder value longer term. Not exchange driven pumps.<br>
15.07.2018 01:28:02, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We have a different token value growth strategy FYI and its aimed at family offices.<br>
15.07.2018 01:29:05, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I can tell from your responses you have a very intuitive and wise view of the crypto markets.<br>
15.07.2018 01:29:10, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: And a genuine high belief in your product.<br>
15.07.2018 01:29:26, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Thank you - and please don’t take this as us trying to come across arrogant.<br>
15.07.2018 01:29:42, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We genuinely do not believe in other teams in this space and are quite disgusted by everything we have seen.<br>
15.07.2018 01:29:54, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: So we’re just keeping our head down atm and dellivering our roadmap, rewarding token holders.<br>
15.07.2018 01:30:44, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Makes sense. I think you’re right. 1000%. Matter fact, I know you’re right.<br>
15.07.2018 01:30:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Part of my check was to make sure the project was still alive too lol<br>
15.07.2018 01:31:07, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: When will this exchange launch?<br>
15.07.2018 01:32:04, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Oh yes very much alive.<br>
15.07.2018 01:32:15, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: So specx will be out in 8-10 weeks from now<br>
15.07.2018 01:33:19, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Also i invite you to ask all token holders about how they feel about our project etc once youve gone over the above Q1 webinar. I think to hear it from the horses mouth as opposed to me, would be more productive possibly.<br>
15.07.2018 01:34:01, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I agree. I got out of the habit of doing that recently because nowadays projects kick you out immediately if they know you’re writing an article on them lol<br>
15.07.2018 01:34:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: But I appreciate that invitation.<br>
15.07.2018 01:35:18, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: lol yes we don’t kick anyone out here<br>
15.07.2018 01:36:27, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: The DALP is interesting.<br>
15.07.2018 01:36:34, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Could I ask more questions about that a bit later?<br>
15.07.2018 01:37:56, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Sorry, I’m in the FA portion of my review as you can see lol. Haven’t had a chance to get to the whitepaper.</p>
<p>This is a good idea though. And I say that because it looks like you all are vying to solve a necessary problem in finance in general, which is bridging the gap between all of the awesome financial instruments of the institutionalized world and the convenience of just trading cryptocurrency.<br>
15.07.2018 01:38:30, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: And that’s a smart idea. Especially if you can be the automatic counterparty to trades and that works out mathematically for you so that there’s always liquidity? That’s fucking brilliant.<br>
15.07.2018 01:39:14, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Platforms like Augur that try to do something similar are limited by the adoption and liquidity. If there’s no liquidity then there’s no market. But you all know that.</p>
<p>Your opinion on exchanges resonates with me too and it shows a sense of understanding of the crypto markets that would give me comfort as an investor (that’s knowledgeable of the markets).<br>
15.07.2018 01:40:16, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Hi yes absolutely.<br>
15.07.2018 01:40:36, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: For due dilligence reasons, would you mind signing an NDA so we know who you are? I am sure you are not from Augur (lol) but we need to be careful as this happened recently<br>
15.07.2018 01:40:39, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: <a href="http://www.moonfolio.com">www.moonfolio.com</a><br>
15.07.2018 01:40:51, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Sure.<br>
15.07.2018 01:40:53, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: ^ setup by a person who is an investor of spectre<br>
15.07.2018 01:41:07, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are launching Moonfolio soon and the one above is not it<br>
15.07.2018 01:41:43, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: This site is pretty awesome. I like it.<br>
15.07.2018 01:42:03, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Webpage]]Also, here are my platforms for reference:</p>

15.07.2018 01:42:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Looking forward to speaking with you more soon!<br>
15.07.2018 01:42:45, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: ok thank you<br>
15.07.2018 01:43:03, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: thanks<br>
15.07.2018 02:35:23, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Question - do you all do bounties for folks that “market”?<br>
15.07.2018 02:35:36, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I think that I could be influential in bringing substantially more awareness to Spectre if interested.<br>
15.07.2018 02:50:49, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Hi we pay cash<br>
15.07.2018 02:51:01, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Bounties depress token price so we are not too keen in that<br>
15.07.2018 02:51:08, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: On<br>
15.07.2018 02:51:13, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Awesome. That’s perfect.<br>
15.07.2018 02:51:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I guess before putting in a formal request, I want to ask: What kind of attention did you want me to attract?<br>
15.07.2018 02:53:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Essentially institutional investor interest from serious long term investors<br>
15.07.2018 02:53:41, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: No pump and dump signals junkies<br>
15.07.2018 02:54:05, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: 1000%. My content is more tailored toward those that approach crypto with their minds rather than blind greed.<br>
15.07.2018 02:55:30, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: We’ve dissected content like why Segregated Witness is a soft fork that may ruin the economic viability of Bitcoin in the long run.<br>
15.07.2018 02:57:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I can help you achieve that goal of attracting attention from long-term investors. Institutional? Possibly. That’s the type of thing where I’d need to send personal messages to people and field offers+garner interest. A bit more extensive. But we can talk about that too.</p>
<p>Are we talking investment into the token directly? Or into some outside entity?<br>
15.07.2018 03:18:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Hi ok all noted sounds good<br>
15.07.2018 03:18:38, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are talking into the token directly<br>
15.07.2018 03:18:43, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: That works.<br>
15.07.2018 03:19:10, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: So, let’s negotiate. Because I have one hell of an article I can publish on Spectre.<br>
15.07.2018 03:21:52, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Ok what are your prices so that I can run the figures by our cmo?<br>
15.07.2018 03:23:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: To write an article, do it justice, and spread it on all platforms and make folks aware of the social media channels as well and encourage interest and an investment of time and (hopefully) money, I generally do $1k flat.<br>
15.07.2018 03:23:47, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I think you’ll find that it’s the gift that keeps on giving. In my personal opinion at least.<br>
15.07.2018 03:53:13, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Ok that sounds fair let’s test yield<br>
15.07.2018 03:53:28, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Please note we don’t do deposits<br>
15.07.2018 03:53:37, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Had been scammed twice recently<br>
15.07.2018 03:54:14, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’ll take you all at your word.<br>
15.07.2018 03:54:30, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: And even provide a draft for you as well. And verifiable proof that I am the owner of all social media accounts that I listed above before requesting payment.<br>
15.07.2018 03:55:37, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: And give the team a chance to correct me on any errors.</p>
<p>My only caveat is that I do not allow anyone I wrote on the behalf of to control the narrative.</p>
<p>I also am requried SEC’s anti-touting laws to divulge that it was a commissioned piece.</p>
<p>I usually put this way at the bottom of the article though.<br>
15.07.2018 04:05:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Much appreciated<br>
15.07.2018 04:06:17, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Agreed<br>
15.07.2018 04:06:24, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Let’s go for it<br>
15.07.2018 04:06:39, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Please note it is imperative you go through our media pack first<br>
15.07.2018 04:06:47, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: And then the above webinar<br>
15.07.2018 04:06:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Those two will bring you up to speed on what we do at spectre<br>
15.07.2018 04:07:14, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: <a href="http://Www.spectre.ai/investors">Www.spectre.ai/investors</a><br>
15.07.2018 04:07:40, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Also note that our platform is strictly closed to US citizens<br>
15.07.2018 04:08:31, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Perfect. The media packages contain information that’s not on the site/whitepaper elsewhere?<br>
15.07.2018 04:10:26, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: No however they summarise everything for prospective investors neatly<br>
15.07.2018 04:10:35, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: The white paper is very long<br>
15.07.2018 04:15:52, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Awesome. I tend to be more into getting right into the meat of things. So, I have no problem deciphering some complex information.<br>
15.07.2018 04:16:36, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Haha all good! Had to write a 50+ page whitepaper a little earlier. So, reading through is no problem!<br>
15.07.2018 04:31:20, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Ok then i suggest you get in touch with bluebarracuda<br>
15.07.2018 04:31:35, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: he has written a series of articles (i think 3 out of a 4 part series) that goes through everything in depth<br>
15.07.2018 04:31:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Oh perfect.<br>
15.07.2018 08:44:39, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Bluebarracudas [@bluebarracudas], 15.07.2018 08:35:08}}<br>
[[Webpage]]<a href="https://medium.com/@bluebarracudas7/why-the-spectre-ai-dividend-token-sxdt-can-generate-enough-passive-income-to-set-you-up-for-life-3f21adba08bb">https://medium.com/@bluebarracudas7/why-the-spectre-ai-dividend-token-sxdt-can-generate-enough-passive-income-to-set-you-up-for-life-3f21adba08bb</a><br>
16.07.2018 00:25:14, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Hey, I remember you mentioned you were interested in larger investor s.<br>
16.07.2018 00:25:34, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: The person that commissioned me to investigate Spectre is a pretty large investor and they are part of an investor group.<br>
16.07.2018 00:26:06, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: My guess is that they have upward of 6 figures to invest into Spectre. Perhaps more.<br>
16.07.2018 00:26:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Good morning, that sounds good. Hopefully they are not based in the U.S?<br>
16.07.2018 00:28:05, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: They’re predominantly in Europe (vast majority). I’m fairly certain they’d be willing to undergo KYC if absolutely necessary as well.<br>
16.07.2018 00:28:53, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: hi yes it is 100% necessary if they wish to claim dividends (weekly)<br>
16.07.2018 00:32:49, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Ah I see. I don’t think it’ll be a problem at all.</p>
<p>Assuming investors are on board and they wish to make a hefty investment into Spectre, are there any discounts that you do for pooled investors? (i.e., something below spot price?)<br>
16.07.2018 00:33:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Hi, unfortunately not, they can purchase them on the exchanges listed here <a href="http://www.spectre.ai/investors">www.spectre.ai/investors</a><br>
16.07.2018 00:36:00, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Is there enough liquidity for them to reasonably spend up to and exceeding $1M?<br>
16.07.2018 00:36:16, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Slippage on price could be monumental. Or the accumulation could take weeks<br>
16.07.2018 00:36:52, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yes accumulation for an order that size would take weeks so they would need to keep a running buy order, it would take around 2-3 months i presume<br>
16.07.2018 00:37:22, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: What if the NASDAQ or someone wanted to invest in Spectre? That would be their only recourse ?<br>
16.07.2018 00:38:02, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: nasdaq would probably buy into the parent company as an equity investment<br>
16.07.2018 00:38:22, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: unless they specifically wanted to invest in our tokens only, then yes only recourse<br>
16.07.2018 00:39:51, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: How would investment into the parent company work? And wouldn’t that effectively be akin to buying tokens since the parent company has ownership over Spectre and the Spectre team itself has ownership over some portion of the tokens?<br>
16.07.2018 00:41:38, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yes that is correct, so a parent company investment would be a traditional equity investment under a shareholder agreement to buy some of our shares<br>
16.07.2018 00:42:02, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: At the end of each year, depending on performance we declare dividends to said shareholders so such a shareholder would have rights to those and of course to the interim weekly dividends we receive on our holdings of the tokens<br>
16.07.2018 00:42:26, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: But please bear in mind that for such parent level investments we are not interested in anything less than $5m.<br>
16.07.2018 00:42:35, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: (the firm has adequate capitalisation)<br>
16.07.2018 00:52:24, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I see. I very well may be able to acquire that $5M.</p>
<p>Will be back in touch very soon with potential questioons about parent company. Don’t need to know anything that is trade secret or not already publicly available information.</p>
<p>Just clarification that you believe an investor should have at their disposal if they truly are considering such an investment.<br>
16.07.2018 00:54:38, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Hi thank you, in the interest of transparency, since we are revenue generating and growing, if such an investment was made into the parent company note that around 30-40% will be used ti buy back our own tokens (both D and U).<br>
16.07.2018 04:19:10, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: That’s fair.<br>
16.07.2018 04:19:41, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I relayed this information by the way, and they said they will stick w tokens. They have no problem accumulating doing so and said they even participated in the ICO.<br>
16.07.2018 05:00:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Ok noted<br>
16.07.2018 05:01:47, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Perhaps Spectre would be willing to commission more  informative articles after the seeing the results of the first one we discussed yesterday.<br>
16.07.2018 05:02:51, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I think it would lead to more general interest &amp; more prospective investors with mature money looking to saddle up with the team rather than make a quick flip.<br>
16.07.2018 05:03:10, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Agreed<br>
16.07.2018 05:03:36, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We will test yield on the first one and if it yields interest we are happy to get one done monthly or bi monthly<br>
21.07.2018 02:58:31, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: How is the article coming alone ?<br>
21.07.2018 02:58:34, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Along<br>
22.07.2018 06:37:01, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Hey! Very good.<br>
22.07.2018 06:37:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Apologies for the delay.<br>
22.07.2018 06:37:21, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Webpage]]I did some rebranding. This is my new publication page <a href="http://medium.com/thedailydose">medium.com/thedailydose</a><br>
22.07.2018 06:37:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Wanted to clean everything up before putting out new content first so that it’s all neatly packaged. So, the article will also be on my homepage as well as my dedicated Telegram channel and my Twitter page as well.<br>
22.07.2018 06:39:22, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: ok perfect<br>
22.07.2018 06:39:24, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: when can we expect it<br>
22.07.2018 07:37:51, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Today.<br>
22.07.2018 07:38:01, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Well today as in EST<br>
22.07.2018 07:40:31, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: nice<br>
23.07.2018 06:09:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Hey<br>
23.07.2018 06:09:52, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I have a slight concern.<br>
23.07.2018 06:10:52, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yes please go ahead<br>
23.07.2018 09:09:25, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Hey, sorry I did not see this response for some reason.<br>
23.07.2018 09:09:48, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Alright, well it’s nothing serious, but I wanted to ask if there’s an opportunity to receive 50% payment up front. Or if there is something that we can do to absolutely guarantee that payment will be rendered<br>
23.07.2018 09:12:10, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: This isn’t necessarily a trust thing, but I’ve had a couple of projects in recent weeks flat out refuse to pay after I delivered the content. I made the foolish move of showing my ambitiousness by publishing the articles before receiving payment when I should have confirmed beforehand.</p>
<p>This has resulted in a distinct change in my personal policy when doing commissioned work.</p>
<p>If you are opposed to this setup, then I’d be more than willing to discuss mutually agreeable alternatives*<br>
23.07.2018 09:13:40, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: As you may appreciate we have been approached by a few service providers (Mainly from Nigeria recently) asking for upfront deposits of 20-50% for articles or videos rendered on YouTube. We fell for the trap twice so for now we are not going to risk it again. Most recently we fell for “Sergio ICO” youtube reviews, turns out it wasn’t the real guy but a con man.<br>
23.07.2018 09:13:54, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: If we don’t pay you can take to the web and spread the word that we are a dishonest company.<br>
23.07.2018 09:14:03, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We have never not paid our suppliers FYI, youc an check with anyone.<br>
23.07.2018 09:14:07, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: No doubt.<br>
23.07.2018 09:14:19, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I also have 250+ articles on my Medium, am well-known in this space, and currently ranked #1 in Bitcoin.<br>
23.07.2018 09:14:29, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: So, while I understand some scammers in Nigeria might pull that, I have a hell of a reputation on the line to do that.<br>
23.07.2018 09:14:32, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yeah see the problem with that is, we dont know its you.<br>
23.07.2018 09:14:39, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’ll post in there now then.<br>
23.07.2018 09:14:40, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: The nigerians also pointed out their large Youtube channels.<br>
23.07.2018 09:14:49, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: YouTube?<br>
23.07.2018 09:14:51, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: lol<br>
23.07.2018 09:14:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Pete let me break this down to you in simple terms.<br>
23.07.2018 09:15:03, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Sure, go ahead.<br>
23.07.2018 09:15:27, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We pay all our suppliers. You are going to have to trust us that <a href="http://Spectre.ai">Spectre.ai</a> a multi million dollar listed company is not going to try and save a few hundred bucks and risk theironline reputation over this.<br>
23.07.2018 09:15:38, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Please do the article, we will review it and you’ll get paid.<br>
23.07.2018 09:15:52, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’ve had a lot of individuals say that. Almost all.<br>
23.07.2018 09:16:06, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: As stated before, I get who you worked with. I’m the #1 contributor in this entire space and the best at what I do.<br>
23.07.2018 09:16:08, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: 50% up front is fair.<br>
23.07.2018 09:16:17, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Absolutely not.<br>
23.07.2018 09:16:25, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Doing work for free doesn’t make sense to me.<br>
23.07.2018 09:16:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Then don’t do it.<br>
23.07.2018 09:16:36, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are not asking you to do free work.<br>
23.07.2018 09:16:48, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You’re asking me to trust you while not extending that same favor.<br>
23.07.2018 09:16:48, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are willing to pay for it, but alas, there is no contract or anything so we need to see the work first.<br>
23.07.2018 09:16:55, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Correct.<br>
23.07.2018 09:16:59, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Because we have been scammed.<br>
23.07.2018 09:17:03, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: So have I.<br>
23.07.2018 09:17:19, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: We have our own interests here, so I can’t see how we would expect to come to any compromise based on that.<br>
23.07.2018 09:17:38, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I just crushed a project yesterday for that.<br>
23.07.2018 09:17:46, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Im sorry<br>
23.07.2018 09:17:49, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It isn’t about money, it’s time.<br>
23.07.2018 09:17:50, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: What do you mean by “crushed”?<br>
23.07.2018 09:18:12, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I had to out them for what they were. They irritated me, I dug deeper and figured out they were bullshit.<br>
23.07.2018 09:18:27, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: But that’s still a waste of time. That’s another 2-3 hours spent on top of the time spent writing something that won’t be used.<br>
23.07.2018 09:18:38, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: That’s my issue. I make enough money. I’m fine on that front.<br>
23.07.2018 09:18:41, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Alright well we’re not in that category of project.<br>
23.07.2018 09:18:48, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: So im not sure if that even applies to us.<br>
23.07.2018 09:19:05, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It doesn’t. And I don’t want to put projects up to an ultimatum for payment either. Doesn’t feel right or good.<br>
23.07.2018 09:19:13, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: PayPal does have a relatively decent facility FYI.<br>
23.07.2018 09:19:37, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: An inital deposit of 10-20% can be sent for ‘goods and services’ if you deliver, then all is fine and we can make the rest of the payment.<br>
23.07.2018 09:19:52, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: If you run off (and you are a scamster for whatever reason), our accounts team does what is known as a chargeback.<br>
23.07.2018 09:19:52, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Do you all do crypto?<br>
23.07.2018 09:19:57, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: This way both sides are protected<br>
23.07.2018 09:20:05, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Of course we do but with known, trusted parties.<br>
23.07.2018 09:20:11, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I understand PayPal lol and how chargebacks work.<br>
23.07.2018 09:20:12, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are not going to send a 50% deposit via crypto<br>
23.07.2018 09:20:21, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: So our offer is fair then right?<br>
23.07.2018 09:20:23, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Then how can I guarantee that my time will not be wasted.<br>
23.07.2018 09:20:27, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: No, I do not use PayPal.<br>
23.07.2018 09:20:38, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You’ve already written the article.<br>
23.07.2018 09:20:44, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: As per your communication to me yesterday<br>
23.07.2018 09:20:53, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: So your time has largely already been spent right?<br>
23.07.2018 09:21:11, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m a hell of a worker, so I split it into a two part article. The extra one is on the house.<br>
23.07.2018 09:21:22, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Would you kindly show us these articles?<br>
23.07.2018 09:21:31, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: If we can see them, then we have no problem in working on your terms<br>
23.07.2018 09:21:36, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You can share them privately<br>
23.07.2018 09:21:41, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I can show the first. Combing through the WP on the second.<br>
23.07.2018 09:21:50, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Ok post it here<br>
23.07.2018 09:21:52, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: First still needs to be cropped to an extent, but give me a moment.<br>
23.07.2018 09:25:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Webpage]]<a href="https://medium.com/thedailydose/spectre-review-9748dcc9993d">https://medium.com/thedailydose/spectre-review-9748dcc9993d</a><br>
23.07.2018 09:25:20, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Temporarily posted on Medium, won’t show up on the main page. This should verify the identity here. Not from Nigeria.<br>
23.07.2018 09:25:53, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It’s a ridiculously high level overview.</p>
<p>2600+ words. And I think it’ll help explain why I’m adamant about ensuring that I don’t really do my homework 1000% and carve out the second article before guaranteeing that I’ll be compensated for the time spent.<br>
23.07.2018 09:27:19, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I love you guys and it’s not about trusting whether you’ll pay. I’ve just noticed that when I do the work first w/o payment, projects start to enforce more conditions upon me like:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“Oh, we’ll pay first, but you need to do x, y, and z now.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They wish to control the narrative and demand certain edits for me to shill for them before I receive payment. I of course have to decline and then, once again, I end up with wasted time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects change their mind after I’ve already finished the project and then they renege on the agreement that we had.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, I trust that you all have the $$. I just can’t trust that the terms will remain the same and that there will not be any additional hurdles for me to climb before receiving said payment.<br>
23.07.2018 09:27:47, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Webpage]]<a href="https://medium.com/@CryptoMedicated">https://medium.com/@CryptoMedicated</a></p>
<p>Here’s the profile btw. I’m actually ranked #1 atm.<br>
23.07.2018 09:28:05, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Webpage]]<a href="https://medium.com/tag/bitcoin/top-writers">https://medium.com/tag/bitcoin/top-writers</a><br>
23.07.2018 09:28:10, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I’ve glanced over the above indeed itlooks like you have put in good effort.<br>
23.07.2018 09:28:23, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Would you kindly send an email from <a href="mailto:cryptomedication@gmail.com">cryptomedication@gmail.com</a> to <a href="mailto:legal@spectre.ai">legal@spectre.ai</a> as well for additional verification<br>
23.07.2018 09:28:52, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: With regards to us “dictating” what you say or controlling the narrative, we dont do that but please understand that factual inaccuracies or incorrect assumptions 100% need to be remedied.<br>
23.07.2018 09:28:55, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Is that fine?<br>
23.07.2018 09:29:47, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: That is 1000% fair.<br>
23.07.2018 09:30:00, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Sent btw<br>
23.07.2018 09:30:37, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: perfect thank you<br>
23.07.2018 09:31:05, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Awesome. I can un-publish that if you all want a chance to look at it a little more critically first<br>
23.07.2018 09:31:40, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yeah our QA person will go through this, Ian Buck and feedback to the team any areas of concern/inaccuracy, then we will ask you what to address before you can publish it.<br>
23.07.2018 09:31:49, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Ian heads up our Investor Relations fyi<br>
23.07.2018 09:32:13, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Sounds great. So in light of the e-mail + showing that, is the 50% possible?<br>
23.07.2018 09:32:39, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: yes, i will holler at legal in a bit once they give green light we can sort this out for you<br>
23.07.2018 09:33:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Awesome. $BTC, $ETH, $LTC, the usual ones work out.<br>
23.07.2018 09:34:07, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: The first article was foreplay, excuse my language. The end of the article is more of the tone for the second one to follow up.<br>
23.07.2018 09:34:30, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Also, was wondering if the smart contract code used for DALP**  was available via GitHub somewhere<br>
23.07.2018 09:34:37, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Was going to have an audit included by my tech team.<br>
23.07.2018 09:34:39, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Are you interested in becoming an affiliate of the platform?<br>
23.07.2018 09:34:45, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: How so?<br>
23.07.2018 09:35:21, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: <a href="http://www.spectre.ai/affiliates">www.spectre.ai/affiliates</a> &lt; you can sign up and our aff team will reach out to you to discuss program details. You say you have a big followiing,  might as well establish a passive income stream from people who read your articles about us and start trading.<br>
23.07.2018 09:36:44, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: regarding the trade smart contracts they have been audited by 3 seperate parties post ICO and we do not put that on GitHub as we do not want Spot Option or other competitors simply copying the SYLO contract and launching another version of Spectre as we have applied for a patent in December itself and these smart contracts comprise that patent application. It’s part of our IP. Our token sale smart contracts, for transparency reasons, are on GitHub yes.<br>
23.07.2018 09:38:21, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I see… I  guess to address:</p>
<p>1.) I would, but I have a strict no-aff link policy to keep the ‘sanctity’ of the brand (no one project seriously favored over the other).</p>
<p>2.) I see. How can users be assured that the contract code is secure? Bancor was recently hacked for $12M+. Smart contracts have been shown to have a high level of bugs in/on them and there’s no way to really put out a bounty on the code either, so how does Spectre assuage those concerns that may or may not pop up in the future?<br>
23.07.2018 09:38:45, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: To continue #2, I think in the context that crypto is in right now, that would cause a little trepidation on my part<br>
23.07.2018 09:39:16, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: If I were an investor*** ^^<br>
23.07.2018 09:40:24, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: regarding 1) noted. regarding 2) the smart contract you are referring to, it does not store any funds on it per se is merely processing trades (throughput) as part of our Wallet decentralised account (its 1 of the 2 accounts we offer). Money sits on the clients offsite eth wallet and then it is sent to the DALP smart contract (which is a multisig nano), via the smart contract in question. Note in terms of “why is it secure” we have paid around $70,000 to Hackerone, a known cryptocurrency security company, to check for security flaws in our contracts, dapp and other areas. All are fault free.<br>
23.07.2018 09:43:27, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: In general, we are not Bancor, their entire network of smart contracts requires massive storage of capital and is a honey pot for hackers.<br>
23.07.2018 09:45:50, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: 1. Referring to that DALP smart contract. What stops that from being compromised? If I’m not referring to the correct one in naming that, then I’m referring to the smart contract that actually holds the funds.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Is there any public acknowledgment of this audit by the company themselves?<br>
23.07.2018 09:48:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: The DALP smart contract is stored across a few multi sig wallets (with 3-4 signatories), the crypto portion that is and the rest (which for hedging purposes is dollar or fiat denominated) across a range of regulated exchanges. This way despite its high level of onchain security (we use nano ledger S hardware walletse which have not been hacked), there is no single contract with large amounts of capital. With regards to what stops a nano ledger S from being compromised you can read over the security measures taken by Gnosis and nano.<br>
23.07.2018 09:50:00, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: 2. Hackerone does not publicly give certificates to companies, we are in a long term contract with them (it is still ongoing as they audit all new features we are adding weekly to our DAPP). If you need verification that we have actually entered einto a relationship and have had multiple audits on our trade smart contracts, you will need to sign an NDA and fly over to meet our team as you will appreciate we do not send proof of emails/contracts between our suppliers and our company to random 3rd parties. If its the police then such information can be obtained by a subponea or search warrant.<br>
23.07.2018 09:52:45, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Hmm I see.<br>
23.07.2018 09:52:48, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Well, that works then.<br>
23.07.2018 09:52:57, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: So, I guess I’ll await further correspondence on the 50%<br>
23.07.2018 09:54:00, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: And Ian Buck who will reach out to you via TG to discuss certain points in the article.<br>
23.07.2018 09:55:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Awesome.<br>
23.07.2018 12:18:28, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I have issue w these proposed changes<br>
23.07.2018 12:18:33, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: “The reference to binary should be removed (even though you state it as “akin to”), as they are not binary options.  And, when describing Smart Options above that you link to this page -<br>
<a href="https://www.cryptotrends.eu/cryptocurrency-smart-options/">https://www.cryptotrends.eu/cryptocurrency-smart-options/</a><br>
It may say Smart Options on that web page, but it is nothing to do with Spectre at all  (it is promoting the anonymous broker ‘Whaleclub’).”<br>
23.07.2018 12:19:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: These are personal preference type suggestions.<br>
23.07.2018 12:20:07, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Hello<br>
23.07.2018 12:20:17, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Hello<br>
23.07.2018 12:20:35, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I agree regarding associating us with Whale Club in anyway.<br>
23.07.2018 12:20:39, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Please ensure it is removed.<br>
23.07.2018 12:20:48, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I didn’t associate you with Whaleclub<br>
23.07.2018 12:21:20, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You link to this website <a href="https://www.cryptotrends.eu/cryptocurrency-smart-options/">https://www.cryptotrends.eu/cryptocurrency-smart-options/</a><br>
23.07.2018 12:21:30, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: This links to Whaleclub &gt; which has a poor online reputation<br>
23.07.2018 12:21:34, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: They have a definition for smart options, no?<br>
23.07.2018 12:21:54, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: From rise of this new asset class that we have engineered<br>
23.07.2018 12:22:04, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: As per ESMA, a smart option varies on 3 different categories vs a binary<br>
23.07.2018 12:22:18, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: promoting “whale club” in the same article as Spectre.<br>
23.07.2018 12:22:41, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: They aren’t promoted.<br>
23.07.2018 12:23:04, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: They are.<br>
23.07.2018 12:23:12, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: In what sentence?<br>
23.07.2018 12:23:23, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Read above what i wrote. Make sure it is removed. We do not wish to be associated with them as they are hijacking the term Smart Options.<br>
23.07.2018 12:23:30, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You link to this right?<br>
23.07.2018 12:23:44, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Read what I put in there, I cropped out the definition of smart options. There’s no mention of WhaleClub<br>
23.07.2018 12:23:55, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: It links to Whale Club<br>
23.07.2018 12:24:00, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I sure do. I’m not removing it. So we have an issue now.<br>
23.07.2018 12:24:03, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Therin lies the issue<br>
23.07.2018 12:24:15, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Alright. Noted.<br>
23.07.2018 12:24:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Sucks. They’re the only ones with a definition<br>
23.07.2018 12:24:21, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Make one on your site and I’ll link it then.<br>
23.07.2018 12:24:35, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: have you done any research on whale club?<br>
23.07.2018 12:25:08, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Whaleclub is featured in the article below<br>
23.07.2018 12:25:20, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: They are not the subject of the post I put up from there.<br>
23.07.2018 12:27:01, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: As expected, here come the games.<br>
23.07.2018 12:27:36, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Take this trophy home with you. You will be the last project in this space to ever get something for free from me. Period.<br>
23.07.2018 12:27:57, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Pete<br>
23.07.2018 12:28:08, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: This has nothing to do with payment, we have already confirmed that with you.<br>
23.07.2018 12:28:31, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Spectre, I have the definition of a term cropped in the article.<br>
23.07.2018 12:28:34, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We do not wish our brand to be tarnished by an unregulated company that is clearly hijacking that term in order to drive traffic to their high leverage trading paltform<br>
23.07.2018 12:28:45, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: What ‘games’ are you referring to?<br>
23.07.2018 12:28:58, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Whaleclub is not the publisher of the article. What are you talking about?<br>
23.07.2018 12:29:08, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You have already started the article off in an accusatory manner (I just read it), and we are not asking you to change this.<br>
23.07.2018 12:29:34, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: On the article, if people want to find out abotu Smart options they click on your provided link yes?<br>
23.07.2018 12:29:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Why would they if I explain it?<br>
23.07.2018 12:29:57, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Right.<br>
23.07.2018 12:30:22, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: 2. The volume is concerning. Again, we talked. It is what it is. I moved on and highlighted many positive aspects of the project<br>
23.07.2018 12:30:46, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: The point is to let them know about spectre, yet if they click on the link, they have deposit or open account options with another broker (unregulated mind you) that provides high leverage crypto trading and is using the term Smart Options although it is we who provide actual Smart Options. Do you not see the issue here?<br>
23.07.2018 12:31:14, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We have already explained to you the volume argument, imnot sure what type of narrative it is you are trying to create but we don’t appreciate false narratives.<br>
23.07.2018 12:31:40, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You have started the article off, veryunprofessionally by claiming “he was defensive”. My colleague here was not defensive at all, he simply shared with you the q1 results…<br>
23.07.2018 12:31:55, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Volumes don’t imply anything if the token is a security and is listed on 1-2 DEXes.<br>
23.07.2018 12:32:23, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Okay. It seems as though I’m not the right person for this - which is why I’m only doing up front $$ from here out.<br>
23.07.2018 12:32:26, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: The fact that we are one of the few projects with a non-beta platofrm and pne that pays weekly dividends AND has paid over 500 ETh in divs, should be ample evidence that we are doing right by investors…<br>
23.07.2018 12:32:35, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Enjoy the free article because I’m sure this was a work around to excuse not paying.<br>
23.07.2018 12:32:54, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You seem to not understand the point at all. We are willing to pay it has nothing to do with that.<br>
23.07.2018 12:32:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: This is the issue I have with working w projects in this space. It will probably be the last time I ever do.<br>
23.07.2018 12:33:04, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are kindly asking you to stop representing us in a false light.<br>
23.07.2018 12:33:08, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: What about that is not clear?<br>
23.07.2018 12:33:24, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Be respectful. I’m not your fucking child. ^<br>
23.07.2018 12:33:33, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I don’t know who you guys think I am<br>
23.07.2018 12:33:49, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m not gonna let you talk shit to me like I’m your employee. Wake up.<br>
23.07.2018 12:33:55, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m another grown ass man. Talk to me like one<br>
23.07.2018 12:34:18, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It’s an article written by me. You can’t control my perception of things<br>
23.07.2018 12:34:21, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: That’s absolutely absurd.<br>
23.07.2018 12:34:31, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Your perception is factually incorrect and misleading.<br>
23.07.2018 12:34:41, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: And clearly based on your expletives, you are not a professional.<br>
23.07.2018 12:34:47, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Please refrain from abuses.<br>
23.07.2018 12:34:53, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Entirely unecessary.<br>
23.07.2018 12:34:58, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: We have no further business.<br>
23.07.2018 12:35:05, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Goodbye.<br>
23.07.2018 12:35:11, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Send payment.<br>
23.07.2018 12:35:48, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Lol. These are the games I’m talking about. I don’t have time for this shit. You have a good project but you’re arrogant.<br>
23.07.2018 12:35:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Nauseatingly so.<br>
23.07.2018 12:36:06, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I see why the volume is what it is.<br>
23.07.2018 12:39:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m on a computer now, so I can type.<br>
23.07.2018 12:39:23, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: The volume is a function of the sxdt token being listed on a few DEXes while we build our own exchange. You are uprising the cryptcurrency community about brokerless trading and Smart OPtions, which we have brought to the Ethereum landscape. There are other affs and some tinpot brokers who are using the term Smart Options in order to divert traffic for FTDs to their own website (and at times as you see with whale club, at very high margin trading arenas which is very risk). We are asking you to do what is logical and simply not include a link to another broker unless you want to have an article that includes all our competition. If this is the case then yes you can include all our competitors and even use our competition matrix document to assist. Butthe current iteration doesnt work.<br>
23.07.2018 12:39:49, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Did you actually read the article?<br>
23.07.2018 12:39:53, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: With regards to payment as stated earlier, we have every intention to compensate those that cover our project accurately. We are not asking you to remove critique; thats important part of the review.<br>
23.07.2018 12:40:04, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yes its a good article and covers pros and cons and there are a lot of pros.<br>
23.07.2018 12:40:08, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I actually gave you credit for great responses.<br>
23.07.2018 12:40:11, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: And defended the answers.<br>
23.07.2018 12:40:12, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Indeed!<br>
23.07.2018 12:40:19, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: The volume was something that one would logically question.<br>
23.07.2018 12:40:30, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I agree…<br>
23.07.2018 12:40:36, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It went from $44M to $7k. You being angry about that doesn’t make sense to me.<br>
23.07.2018 12:40:40, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: it is low and there is a reason behind it and its not that "we are arrogant"<br>
23.07.2018 12:40:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are not angry about the volumes please don’t put up false narratives here.<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:00, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are not angry…it is you who is using expletives.<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:04, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Again.<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:05, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: False narratives??<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:10, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: What is the game here?<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Let’s cut to the chase with this.<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:16, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are asking you to look at the terminology of Smart Options<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:23, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: No let us not<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:26, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: What about the terminology specifically is inaccurate?<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:34, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Ok if you will stop typing, perhaps I can explain?<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:52, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: What? Lol. Okay, explain…<br>
23.07.2018 12:41:56, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: alright<br>
23.07.2018 12:43:27, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You have explained Smart Options on the article itself, however you have left out early close and ‘trade insurance’ or ‘capital protection’ ahead of entry, however you have included smart contracts. So 2/3 items need to be added and then that is our USP. Those are effectively Smart Options. The article you point to in the article goes to another affiliate website which is clearly promoting Whaleclub who have given the definition of a Smart OPtion but their definition is just a binary option. I.e its equivalent to the definition of a binary option. So its conflicting.<br>
23.07.2018 12:43:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: All we are asking you to do is to not do that but just describe the Smart Option in depth on your own article and not point to a random definotion on the web which is incorrect.<br>
23.07.2018 12:44:41, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Does that make sense?<br>
23.07.2018 12:45:43, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Can you provide a link from Spectre that defines this?<br>
23.07.2018 12:47:07, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yes, these last two weeks our website is undergoing an ‘overhaul’ as the definitions are being translated into c. 7 languages, this will appear where it used to (bottom of landing page), it is temporarily removed during this overhaul process as the new UI comes in c. 6 weeks. If you can wait until this is done (2 weeks or so), then you can point directly to our website or some of our trusted affiliates are adding this definition soon so you can link to them. Whatever works.<br>
23.07.2018 12:53:05, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Sure, I can put that in if you provide it on your website in a couple of weeks.<br>
23.07.2018 12:53:13, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: But until then…I can’t reference something that does not exist…<br>
23.07.2018 12:53:43, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Ok sounds good, btw that is all we really wanted. the BO brand has been destroyed by tinpot brokers over the last years so now they make a comeback using “Smart Options” and so we are extra careful to be associated with them.<br>
23.07.2018 12:54:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I mean it’s a 2500+ word article man. I think the unique qualities of Spectre are covered pretty fully.<br>
23.07.2018 12:54:17, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Noted, let me get a team member to search out a more reliable place that lists the definition.<br>
23.07.2018 12:55:01, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We have moved beyond this, as i said earlier, the only reason it went to quality control is because yes its a good article. Overall its fair and balanced. Im not sure why exactly you feel we dont want to pay for it, thats not who we are.<br>
23.07.2018 12:55:27, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: But we don’t make apologies for ensuring there is no confusion about our brand/ethos especially given there are so many scam brokers out there who will hitch a ride on this new Smart Options gravy train.<br>
23.07.2018 12:56:10, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Right. But I’m not part of the Spectre brand. I’m merely covering the article to bring it greater awareness. But, you want me to sort of make sure that Spectre shines in the greatest light possible, and there’s nothing authentic about that.<br>
23.07.2018 12:56:39, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: If the definition is, in fact, accurate, and the only qualm is the source of the definition (even though it doesn’t come from a Whaleclub controlled source), then yes, it feels like I’m just being a PR team for someone.<br>
23.07.2018 12:56:50, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You are conflating us wanting you to represent Smart Options a new asset class and not be associated with unregulated high leverage traders with us wanting to be painted in a best light possible.<br>
23.07.2018 12:57:00, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I just stated its NOT accurate.<br>
23.07.2018 12:57:18, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: It is missing 2 key components, the Smart Options definition on that whaleclub website is just a binary option…<br>
23.07.2018 12:57:19, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: And the definition you gave is very ambiguous.<br>
23.07.2018 12:57:25, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: No its not.<br>
23.07.2018 12:57:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: What is ambigious about it?<br>
23.07.2018 12:58:59, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Photo]]<br>
23.07.2018 12:59:10, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Okay, so your website is linked and it goes down the order of everything that’s on there.<br>
23.07.2018 12:59:23, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I provide a brief side-definition of smart options for people.<br>
23.07.2018 12:59:49, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Photo]]<br>
23.07.2018 12:59:53, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: And thats fine, what we are asking you to do is add those 2 additional items re early close and capital protection (as those features are going in demo shortly)<br>
23.07.2018 13:00:12, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: This definition is not a Smart Option, its a binary option.<br>
23.07.2018 13:01:33, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: So, what is ‘early close’?<br>
23.07.2018 13:02:12, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Early close allows for partial recovery in profit (if in the money) or partial recovery of capital invested (if out of the money) prior to expiry.<br>
23.07.2018 13:02:25, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: This is not a feature in Binaries and part of the reason all the scam went down<br>
23.07.2018 13:02:36, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: A question<br>
23.07.2018 13:03:07, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: [[Photo]]<br>
23.07.2018 13:03:14, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: This is your channel right?<br>
23.07.2018 13:03:17, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It is.<br>
23.07.2018 13:04:06, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m not seeing anything about ‘early close’ on the website (?)<br>
23.07.2018 13:04:44, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yes it was there up until 2 weeks ago as with the entire definotion, as stated earlier in our convo, it is being re-added after being translated across c7 languages in 2 weeks. Hence the wait. It is also being added to the two videos on site as per our regulator requirement.<br>
23.07.2018 13:05:02, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Our affs are also receiving this definition over the coming weeks so you can point to them<br>
23.07.2018 13:05:12, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I took screenshots of the whole website and didn’t see it on there. So, perhaps before we met<br>
23.07.2018 13:05:31, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: But I can’t include something that’s not there…<br>
23.07.2018 13:05:38, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: yes it was earlier this month, exact date i can get<br>
23.07.2018 13:06:10, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You dont need to include a website that is pointing to a binary options broker. They arent into Smart Options. That definition of Smart Options is entirely inaccurate. So you could not just not point there.<br>
23.07.2018 13:06:20, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Does it serve your “ethos” by saying you are anti whale but if people click the link on your article about spectre, they are being aksed to deposit at Whaleclub?<br>
23.07.2018 13:07:13, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Whaleclub isn’t mentioned in that article. They also aren’t mentioned in my article.<br>
23.07.2018 13:07:20, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You’re angry because the PUBLICATION wrote about Whaleclub lol<br>
23.07.2018 13:07:26, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are not angry.<br>
23.07.2018 13:07:33, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Can I not cite cointelegraph now because they wrote about Whaleclub?<br>
23.07.2018 13:07:49, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: The definition in that publication is not accurate. That is our problem.<br>
23.07.2018 13:07:59, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Whaleclub - you can replace with any other broker name we have nothing against them.<br>
23.07.2018 13:08:11, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: No, it is. You’re claiming there are extra features your smart options have that other brokerages don’t.<br>
23.07.2018 13:08:19, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: That’s awesome. I can include that when it’s actually somewhere for me to do so.<br>
23.07.2018 13:08:32, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yes in two weeks or so it should be live, until then you can sit tight.<br>
23.07.2018 13:08:34, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Thats not a big ask.<br>
23.07.2018 13:08:40, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: And that doesnt mean we wont “pay”.<br>
23.07.2018 13:08:57, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: So, how would we go about doing that?<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:02, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Payment* specifically<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:06, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: FYI - im chris, and i work here in support (been here since a while), im not the “boss” of spectre. I do work with the management team and 2 of them man this account from time to time.<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:21, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: we will get to that shortly first i want you to pay close attention and DO NOT abuse.<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Pete Mercury [@PeteMercury], 23.07.2018 12:37:35}}<br>
Your owner or boss went off about the article. I’m taking it down. This is the childish, dumb shit that I can’t stand when working with projects.<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Pete Mercury [@PeteMercury], 23.07.2018 12:38:31}}<br>
If you don’t send payment, I’m defintely revealing the correspondecne we had.<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Pete Mercury [@PeteMercury], 23.07.2018 12:38:39}}<br>
And I’m revealing the petty issue that you all are refusing payment over.<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:38, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: a) I am not the "boss"<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:45, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Chris, come on, I don’t have time for this.<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:47, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: b) we are not witholding payment for the 10th time we are happy to pay<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:51, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: How are we settling the payment out?<br>
23.07.2018 13:09:53, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: c) You cannot threaten us like this<br>
23.07.2018 13:10:14, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It’s not a threat, Chris. The definition looks fine to me. I truly looked into it. I think I was generous to Spectre in the article.<br>
23.07.2018 13:10:20, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Do you feel threatening us like this is professional when we are and always have been willing to pay?<br>
23.07.2018 13:10:22, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You’re harping on something that’s honestly very minor.<br>
23.07.2018 13:10:32, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Are you blackmailing us?<br>
23.07.2018 13:10:41, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I don’t have time for this shit.<br>
23.07.2018 13:10:43, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Despite us reiterating that we will pay.<br>
23.07.2018 13:11:19, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: When you have calmed down and are willing to behave professionally with a professional firm, please get back to us. I do not appreciate being mislabelled and our team threatened with defamation when all we have done is comply.<br>
23.07.2018 13:11:27, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: This entire conversation is saved.<br>
23.07.2018 13:11:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Talk soon.<br>
23.07.2018 13:11:33, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: What did you just say to me?<br>
23.07.2018 13:11:41, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: What is wrong with you?<br>
23.07.2018 13:11:56, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Please i am not the one who is abusing here or threatening our staff “pay or else”.<br>
23.07.2018 13:12:07, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: we don’t appreciate threats<br>
23.07.2018 13:12:11, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Okay. I don’t have time for this.<br>
23.07.2018 13:12:17, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Honor your agreement. Let’s settle up this payment and move on.<br>
23.07.2018 13:12:25, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Photo]]<br>
23.07.2018 13:12:38, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I was just liaising with someone asking me about the investment in Spectre before. They were what prompted the research.<br>
23.07.2018 13:12:50, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’ve put in a good word for you all in different places. You’re being a belligerent jackass.<br>
23.07.2018 13:12:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Think.<br>
23.07.2018 13:13:21, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You have threatend our team to “expose us” or else. Do you think we buckle to threats Pete? You can tell those investors what you like.<br>
23.07.2018 13:13:31, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You have abused using 4 letter words.<br>
23.07.2018 13:13:36, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You are well out of line.<br>
23.07.2018 13:13:44, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: They shouldn’t have you managing this account.<br>
23.07.2018 13:13:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Seriously.<br>
23.07.2018 13:14:13, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Thanks for the feedback. I guess journalistic integrity as you point out to  my colleague includes threatening companies to pay or else you will defame them.<br>
23.07.2018 13:14:29, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Why are you making shit up?<br>
23.07.2018 13:14:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 23.07.2018 09:13:54}}<br>
If we don’t pay you can take to the web and spread the word that we are a dishonest company.<br>
23.07.2018 13:14:58, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Didn’t you send that to me? ^<br>
23.07.2018 13:15:23, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: When in our discussion the one you had with my colleauge or myself did we ever mention we will not pay you?<br>
23.07.2018 13:15:27, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Point it out.<br>
23.07.2018 13:15:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Pete Mercury [@PeteMercury], 23.07.2018 12:38:39}}<br>
And I’m revealing the petty issue that you all are refusing payment over.<br>
23.07.2018 13:16:00, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: This is an all out lie.<br>
23.07.2018 13:16:04, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Have I been paid?<br>
23.07.2018 13:16:16, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Because we’ve come to terms. You have an article. And it is published.<br>
23.07.2018 13:17:35, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yes and out of a professional courtesy we have asked you, and provided ample reason, as to why your definition of Smart Options needs tweaking and certainly pointing to a publication that gives a binary option definition which creates confusion. Instead of trying to understand what we are asking you automatically assume we are not paying. I am not the accounts team Pete. You have written to legal and once they verify your identity whatever we agreed here will be actioned.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:06, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Keep the money then. It’s poor business ethic and I don’t operate like that.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:14, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You clearly don’t get it.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:17, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I already agreed to import the new definition in when you put it up.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:19, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You don’t.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:20, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Incapable of understanding basic logic.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:27, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yes and that doesnt work.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:40, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Because in the interim you are sending many people to a false definition and to another broker.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:49, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: They are not ‘brokerless’ so it defeats the purpose.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:50, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You say disrespectful shit like this and that’s why we’re at odds. Don’t talk to me like that.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:54, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I don’t understand what your issue is.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:59, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: If you dont get it.<br>
23.07.2018 13:18:59, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I spoke favorably about Spectre and wrote a good article.<br>
23.07.2018 13:19:04, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I agree<br>
23.07.2018 13:19:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: So stop being an asshole.<br>
23.07.2018 13:19:31, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Seriously. That’s no way to talk to anyone. Professional or not.<br>
23.07.2018 13:19:34, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Is it possible to refrain from expletives? This profanity is not required.<br>
23.07.2018 13:19:37, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: No.<br>
23.07.2018 13:19:43, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Listen<br>
23.07.2018 13:19:52, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Because you’re sitting here trying to demean me. That’s not called for at all.<br>
23.07.2018 13:19:54, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You clearly have some kind of agenda  here. So here is how it plays out.<br>
23.07.2018 13:19:59, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Since you have openly threatened us.<br>
23.07.2018 13:20:04, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I will forward all of this to legal now.<br>
23.07.2018 13:20:16, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yet you are calling me a ‘fucker’ and ‘asshole’.<br>
23.07.2018 13:20:24, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Okay. This is getting childish at this point.<br>
23.07.2018 13:20:32, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: If you need this ‘win’. Take it.<br>
23.07.2018 13:20:41, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I was never against you guys to begin with.<br>
23.07.2018 13:20:45, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: No<br>
23.07.2018 13:20:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Webpage]]<a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMedicated/status/1018666653096333314">https://twitter.com/CryptoMedicated/status/1018666653096333314</a><br>
23.07.2018 13:20:48, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Your problem is with me<br>
23.07.2018 13:20:51, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Webpage]]<a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMedicated/status/1018423627941900288">https://twitter.com/CryptoMedicated/status/1018423627941900288</a><br>
23.07.2018 13:20:53, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Right?<br>
23.07.2018 13:21:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I don’t know you man. I’m just trying to finish this and move about my day.<br>
23.07.2018 13:21:42, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Alright noted. You can send the team your btc/eth address. It seems you don’t trust us to pay so i will let them know to make it.<br>
23.07.2018 13:21:45, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I thought the project was a solid idea. I’ve stated as much multiple times. I’m not understanding these issues.<br>
23.07.2018 13:21:49, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Hopefully thereafter you can take our request seriously.<br>
23.07.2018 13:21:53, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: What request?<br>
23.07.2018 13:22:18, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: until a formal definition of smart options appears on our aff sites or on our site, please dont link to a random publication that just gives a definition of abinary option.<br>
23.07.2018 13:22:25, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: that is all we ask<br>
23.07.2018 13:22:42, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: There’s no other alternative definition out there.<br>
23.07.2018 13:22:57, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Its a new asset class, why cant you just put it on your article.<br>
23.07.2018 13:22:59, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: The next article is literally supposed to be a deep dive into the whitepaper and the tech.<br>
23.07.2018 13:23:01, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Why link to a random broker?<br>
23.07.2018 13:23:56, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Listen, you remind me of me in a lot of ways.<br>
23.07.2018 13:24:00, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m not sure how old you are<br>
23.07.2018 13:24:17, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: But not every fight is worth going to war over. Trust me.<br>
23.07.2018 13:24:31, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Can you let me know where I am being unfair please.<br>
23.07.2018 13:24:32, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: And not everyone is here to fight you.<br>
23.07.2018 13:24:37, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Didn’t say you were.<br>
23.07.2018 13:25:03, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m just giving you some serious outside advice - not everything has to be escalated<br>
23.07.2018 13:25:34, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I get that it’s not the ideal definition you guys want. I think that Spectre will survive until the definition can be put in. There’s no mention of Whaleclub there in the article I wrote…at all.<br>
23.07.2018 13:25:41, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I have countless screenshots of the website from top to bottom.<br>
23.07.2018 13:25:52, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Every piece of branding on that site is covered in the article. In a glowing manner.<br>
23.07.2018 13:26:32, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: This is a really minor issue and you’re looking to blow everything up on this. And I don’t understand that. I said I have no problem changing it when the new definition is on the site. It’s a small update. I don’t think it’s that big of a deal.<br>
23.07.2018 13:27:01, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Going for the low blows immediately by questioning my integrity, professionalism, and saying “I’m forwarding this to legal” is crazy man.</li>
</ol>
<p>relax. I’ve spoken well on Spectre<br>
23.07.2018 13:27:22, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: This is the ETH address: 0xf1e0a7b4A04A0c9E3D54fe094f09595b4Dc3f446<br>
23.07.2018 13:27:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: All noted above. Pete i will take your advice as I do not mean to come across hostile.<br>
23.07.2018 13:28:05, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Are you aware of David Hay?<br>
23.07.2018 13:28:19, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: No clue who they are<br>
23.07.2018 13:30:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Great.<br>
23.07.2018 13:30:59, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I have no affiliation to these people.<br>
23.07.2018 13:31:36, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Can you state that in your article then or somewhere so that when people do click on the link and they find whaleclub promoted by that publication, they are aware its not indirectly promoted by you?<br>
23.07.2018 13:32:00, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Dude you’re being insane about this lol<br>
23.07.2018 13:32:08, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Like I feel like you guys are about to tell me this is a prank<br>
23.07.2018 13:32:11, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: It’s not me personally its our policy.<br>
23.07.2018 13:32:26, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You had a chat with Ian right? He picked up on this and then sent it around to check with us all.<br>
23.07.2018 13:34:48, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m not doing that.<br>
23.07.2018 13:35:10, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It’s an ad at the bottom of the article. No different than what CMC has.<br>
23.07.2018 13:35:52, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: The ad unfortunately is not ad-sense its actually an onsite promotion of a binary broker (it seems whaleclub offers bins based on this).<br>
23.07.2018 13:36:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Pete Mercury [@PeteMercury], 15.07.2018 03:23:09}}<br>
To write an article, do it justice, and spread it on all platforms and make folks aware of the social media channels as well and encourage interest and an investment of time and (hopefully) money, I generally do $1k flat.<br>
23.07.2018 13:36:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Pete Mercury [@PeteMercury], 15.07.2018 03:23:47}}<br>
I think you’ll find that it’s the gift that keeps on giving. In my personal opinion at least.<br>
23.07.2018 13:36:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 15.07.2018 03:53:13}}<br>
Ok that sounds fair let’s test yield<br>
23.07.2018 13:36:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 15.07.2018 03:53:28}}<br>

23.07.2018 13:36:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 15.07.2018 03:53:37}}<br>
Had been scammed twice recently<br>
23.07.2018 13:36:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Pete Mercury [@PeteMercury], 15.07.2018 03:54:14}}<br>
I’ll take you all at your word.<br>
23.07.2018 13:36:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Pete Mercury [@PeteMercury], 15.07.2018 03:54:30}}<br>
And even provide a draft for you as well. And verifiable proof that I am the owner of all social media accounts that I listed above before requesting payment.<br>
23.07.2018 13:36:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: {{FWD: Pete Mercury [@PeteMercury], 15.07.2018 03:55:37}}<br>
And give the team a chance to correct me on any errors.</p>
<p>My only caveat is that I do not allow anyone I wrote on the behalf of to control the narrative.</p>
<p>I also am requried SEC’s anti-touting laws to divulge that it was a commissioned piece.</p>
<p>I usually put this way at the bottom of the article though.<br>
23.07.2018 13:37:42, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: So, draft submitted.<br>
23.07.2018 13:37:51, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: As you can see we are not trying to control the narrative, your article takes care of that well. It’s a definitional thing on that 3rd party site and the association with a binary broker (latter point seems to be less of an issue).<br>
23.07.2018 13:38:10, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You don’t have an alternative definition of smart option that contradicts that.<br>
23.07.2018 13:38:49, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: At this moment we do not, which is why we ask you keep the correct def. on your website for now until the terminology is on our own website as mentioned earlier (its being updated for languages and esma)<br>
23.07.2018 13:39:02, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Is that a tall order?<br>
23.07.2018 13:39:03, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: No because that’s not an honest thing to do.<br>
23.07.2018 13:39:04, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Yes it is.<br>
23.07.2018 13:39:14, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I can’t call that an objective review. That’s not right.<br>
23.07.2018 13:39:38, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: But the publication you are linking to may be promoting an outright scam so what definitional integrity does it have? I.e its not the meriam webster of finance right? Had you linked to <a href="http://investing.com">investing.com</a> I wouldne be engaged in this.<br>
23.07.2018 13:39:50, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: *would not be<br>
23.07.2018 13:39:58, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It’s a scam in your opinion and that of someone on YouTube.<br>
23.07.2018 13:40:05, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Do they have any criminal charges pending against them?<br>
23.07.2018 13:40:33, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I am not saying they are a scam, I am saying based on online research their online reputation is not right and on top of that the page you are linking to gives the definition of a binary option platform which we really arent.<br>
23.07.2018 13:40:41, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: There are 2 issues here the latter bigger than the former.<br>
23.07.2018 13:41:02, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I don’t claim you to be one. Can’t go around in circles about this the entire day.<br>
23.07.2018 13:41:06, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: And at present you are not willing to budge although these are important points for us. It has nothing to do with negative views on our product by you.<br>
23.07.2018 13:41:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Can’t see me changing it. That’s my final decision. So, you’ll have to punish me however you see fit for it.<br>
23.07.2018 13:41:34, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I don’t have any agenda to promote a competitor or whatever else you’re accusing me of.<br>
23.07.2018 13:42:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We’re not accusing you of anything. Clearly you don’t understand how traders think and herein lies the serious problem. They will immediately read into your article and think you are indirectly affiliated with whale club and somehow so are we. Not all but some will. We know because we’ve been in this space for years.<br>
23.07.2018 13:43:22, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Can you link to this instead perhaps?<br>
23.07.2018 13:43:23, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: [[Webpage]]<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/broker-less-trading-platform-brings-perpetual-liquidity-smart-options-to-bitcoin">https://cointelegraph.com/news/broker-less-trading-platform-brings-perpetual-liquidity-smart-options-to-bitcoin</a><br>
23.07.2018 13:43:27, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: its by CT<br>
23.07.2018 13:44:08, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: There’s no definition for smart options on there.<br>
23.07.2018 13:44:21, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Theres no definition of smart options on the whaleclub thing.<br>
23.07.2018 13:44:25, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Thats a binary option definition.<br>
23.07.2018 13:44:33, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: So why link to a random website which is promoting binaries<br>
23.07.2018 13:45:30, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: In a prediction market, the investor bets on a future outcome but does not own the underlying assets. These bets are based on binary “all-or-nothing” outcomes, providing the broker with more incentive to ensure he does not lose all his money. Digital binary options have quickly grown into a $200–500 million market.<br>
23.07.2018 13:45:35, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: That’s literally in the article ^^<br>
23.07.2018 13:45:43, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: That you gave to me.<br>
23.07.2018 13:46:12, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Yeah its not a great definitionbut at least its not including a link to another broker (and one that has a questionable rep online)…again as stated in two weeks you will have the formal definition.<br>
23.07.2018 13:46:26, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: "They allow investors to forecast future price direction on fiat and, more recently, cryptocurrencies. With fees, you will need to win 55 percent or more of the time to make money. Also, remember the laws of statistical variance. Markets revert to the mean. The more times you bet, the more likely you will come out even, before fees.</p>
<p>The migration of prediction markets to decentralized Blockchain platforms is offering traders much more than liberation from high fees. Some binary trading platforms are allowing traders to choose what to bet on, while others are making traders part owners and paying them dividends."<br>
23.07.2018 13:46:44, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Okay. Just know that they literally defined it the exact same way I did. They actually made it even more comparable to binary options than me.<br>
23.07.2018 13:47:15, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Agreed its a crap definition<br>
23.07.2018 13:47:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m going to take that excerpt and put it in there in place of what was there before.<br>
23.07.2018 13:47:25, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I don’t think it’s “crap”.<br>
23.07.2018 13:47:37, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Lol not everyone outside of you is some bumbling idiot that doesn’t get it.<br>
23.07.2018 13:47:43, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Pete<br>
23.07.2018 13:47:45, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I understand you want your platform to stand out. I do business. I get it.<br>
23.07.2018 13:47:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We are not a binary options platform  and so defining us in this light hurts our brokerless vision<br>
23.07.2018 13:48:09, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Binary Options are all but dead apart from 3 brokers<br>
23.07.2018 13:48:24, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You weren’t defined in that light.<br>
23.07.2018 13:49:00, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: This is me describing ONE aspect of the platform after screenshotting and including all of the material that you all have written on the site<br>
23.07.2018 13:50:13, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Look - i dont want to waste your time anymore, this isn’t going anywhere. You simply aren’t seeing the issue and here is the thing, we’re all professional traders here and most of us internally find this problematic (its not me vs you, its all of us vs you on this topic). We will as per the agreement made, wire you the funds for what you have written so far, if you don’t want to change it thats fine, but note that I cannot realistically expect us to go down this path where you just can’t get on the same page with regards to our brand concerns. This is one of many issues that may crop up in the future and you are extremely difficult not to mention properly abusive and threatening to work with.<br>
23.07.2018 13:50:17, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Take the money and move on. Fine?<br>
23.07.2018 13:50:30, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: (i wont escalate this to the management for now)<br>
23.07.2018 13:51:02, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I agreed to swap out the definition with the CoinTelegraph article you provided.<br>
23.07.2018 13:51:13, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I am sorry I missed that.<br>
23.07.2018 13:51:14, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I don’t get this.<br>
23.07.2018 13:51:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I guess in all this back and forth I missed it, sec<br>
23.07.2018 13:51:56, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Yeah. I’m not here to derail Spectre man<br>
23.07.2018 13:52:30, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I don’t understand where that’s coming from. Nobody is trying to minimize the platform or promote a competitor or anything like that. Lol. I’m literally working WITH you on this<br>
23.07.2018 13:52:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You gotta relax.<br>
23.07.2018 13:54:10, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: its 7pm here payments person  will be in tomorrow 9am, so this is a payment of $500 via ETH to Pete Mercury, [23.07.18 18:27]<br>
This is the ETH address: 0xf1e0a7b4A04A0c9E3D54fe094f09595b4Dc3f446<br>
23.07.2018 13:54:12, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: right?<br>
23.07.2018 13:54:21, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Why not $1k?<br>
23.07.2018 13:54:47, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: The $1k is for the entire thing both parts right? (so 50% of $1k for this part)?<br>
23.07.2018 13:55:18, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: No, for this as has been covered. Because I underestimated the magnitude of this piece. It’s 2,500+ words. It’s a full article.<br>
23.07.2018 13:55:44, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Covers the background, interview we had, ICO, the website, the idea behind it, I’ve swapped out the smart options article.<br>
23.07.2018 13:55:57, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I wanted to do that sort of as an add-on before because I wanted to see Spectre win and get some good extra promotion…<br>
23.07.2018 13:56:10, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Alright so $1,000. After this is wired to  you, confirm it and as discussed at the start of our converation, let us test the yield on it and feedback you receive. Based on how that goes we can then do the 2nd article.<br>
23.07.2018 13:56:16, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Sure.<br>
23.07.2018 13:58:40, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: [[Webpage]]Changes have been submitted: <a href="https://medium.com/thedailydose/spectre-review-9748dcc9993d">https://medium.com/thedailydose/spectre-review-9748dcc9993d</a><br>
23.07.2018 13:59:20, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: As said before, you don’t have to disrespect people to get your point across.<br>
23.07.2018 13:59:35, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Treating folks like equal human beings goes a long way in this space and in real life too. Not everyone is trying to fuck you up. I promise.<br>
23.07.2018 14:00:11, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’m a reasonable person. I just don’t like being spoken to a certain type of way. I didn’t come at you guys like that in any way to warrant that<br>
23.07.2018 14:00:41, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: We can disagree with you having to try to cut me down as a human being lol<br>
23.07.2018 14:01:31, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It’s not that serious. We are blessed. You’re helping run a crypto project. I’m able to write for a crypto project. Life’s too short to make grudges out of small things. That is not what I’m into.<br>
23.07.2018 14:02:30, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: My intention was not to cut you down or demean you in anyway. Clearly it has resulted in that. For that I apologise.<br>
23.07.2018 14:02:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: All good. And apologies on my behalf for the curse words<br>
23.07.2018 14:03:08, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Thething about communication via text (in this day and age where everyting is just dehumanised via internet chat) makes intonation and other emotional cues tough to bring across.<br>
23.07.2018 14:03:29, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: From my perspective and the team’s i am sure, we are just overly protective of our brand especially given what is happening in crypto.<br>
23.07.2018 14:03:38, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: (definitely not looking to wage war)<br>
23.07.2018 14:04:33, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Right. But blasting everyone that doesn’t speak about your brand exactly how you speak about it may undermine that lol<br>
23.07.2018 14:05:04, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It’s just a matter of choosing battles imo. This is one small aspect, of one article among a sea of articles you’ll be putting out for an entire exchange platform  you’re launching.<br>
23.07.2018 14:05:18, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Understood, can you confirm so that i can identify what was said by me, that seemed i attacked you in the first place?<br>
23.07.2018 14:07:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 23.07.2018 12:22:18}}<br>
You cannot be serious in promoting “whale club” in the same article as Spectre.<br>
23.07.2018 14:07:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 23.07.2018 12:23:23}}<br>
Read above what i wrote. Make sure it is removed. We do not wish to be associated with them as they are hijacking the term Smart Options.<br>
23.07.2018 14:07:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 23.07.2018 12:24:35}}<br>
have you done any research on whale club?<br>
23.07.2018 14:07:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 23.07.2018 12:28:34}}<br>
We do not wish our brand to be tarnished by an unregulated company that is clearly hijacking that term in order to drive traffic to their high leverage trading paltform<br>

You have already started the article off in an accusatory manner (I just read it), and we are not asking you to change this.<br>
23.07.2018 14:07:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 23.07.2018 12:31:14}}<br>
We have already explained to you the volume argument, imnot sure what type of narrative it is you are trying to create but we don’t appreciate false narratives.<br>
23.07.2018 14:07:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 23.07.2018 12:31:40}}<br>
You have started the article off, veryunprofessionally by claiming “he was defensive”. My colleague here was not defensive at all, he simply shared with you the q1 results…<br>
23.07.2018 14:07:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 23.07.2018 12:32:54}}<br>
You seem to not understand the point at all. We are willing to pay it has nothing to do with that.<br>

23.07.2018 14:08:27, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Would you kindly add these regions as ‘restricted’ in your article somewhere (this is an instruction our content includes as per legal)<br>

23.07.2018 14:09:18, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I don’t work for Spectre lol. I don’t think that it’s something that would come back legally<br>
23.07.2018 14:09:28, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: But in terms of what I mentioned above<br>
23.07.2018 14:09:44, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: “[Forwarded from Spectre]<br>
We are kindly asking you to stop representing us in a false light.” That’s wildly disrespectful. Come on lol<br>
23.07.2018 14:10:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: “tarnished”, “Not sure what type of narrative…we don’t appreciate false narratives”, "started the article off, very unpressionally…"<br>
23.07.2018 14:10:30, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You went full tilt with pretty much saying I’m a liar that’s trying to undermine your brand by making you look bad because I have a hidden agenda.<br>
23.07.2018 14:10:43, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: To clarify this was not aimed at the content of your article, it was aimed at you trying to insinuate that we don’t wish to pay. We always did and will. Hence my statement about ‘false light’ as you mentioned many crypto projects screw you over.<br>
23.07.2018 14:11:40, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I’m not sure what gave off the vibe that we weren’t going to pay. As per your agreement earlier with us, you would first write the article and then we would pay you. This morning you reversed stance on this and requested 50% deposit and we agreed eventually.<br>
23.07.2018 14:11:57, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Gee, I dont’ know what could’ve given off that vibe…<br>
23.07.2018 14:12:18, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: “Oh you’re writing a false and misleading article about us that tarnishes our brand!”</p>
<p>"Here’s $500 now my friend"<br>
23.07.2018 14:12:22, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Can you clarify what did? because its definitely not how we operate.<br>
23.07.2018 14:12:40, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: This was never said Pete.<br>
23.07.2018 14:12:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It actually was<br>
23.07.2018 14:13:12, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: "Your perception is factually incorrect and misleading."<br>
23.07.2018 14:13:15, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: One of our objections was to be put in the sameboat as another potential bucketshop.<br>
23.07.2018 14:13:55, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I didn’t mention them. There’s an article that provides a definition for smart options (same as CoinTelegraph), that happens to have an ad at the bottom of it for a competitor you don’t like.<br>
23.07.2018 14:14:30, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: If it was Oanda we would have no problem as they are CFTC regulated. Yes we have problems being put in the boat with 20-100x leverage providers that are unregulated.<br>
23.07.2018 14:14:44, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: If you come fro our industry, you will know what I am on about.<br>
23.07.2018 14:14:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Augur isn’t regulated<br>
23.07.2018 14:14:56, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: And they were mentioned directly in the same article as you all<br>
23.07.2018 14:14:59, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Yes.<br>
23.07.2018 14:15:50, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Because if it’s so important to you to make the distinction clear then the info should be up on your site. Or at least an article on your own platform<br>
23.07.2018 14:15:57, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Then there wouldn’t be any room for interpretation<br>
23.07.2018 14:16:32, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You can’t just not put that out there, then accuse people of trying to undermine you.<br>
23.07.2018 14:16:39, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We have mentioned Augur in our materials and also the ‘private liqudity/market maker’ model at length.<br>
23.07.2018 14:16:44, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We did.<br>
23.07.2018 14:16:53, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: But we don’t go around promoting augur which is night and day compared to us.<br>
23.07.2018 14:17:05, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Regarding regulation you realise they offering online gambling right?<br>
23.07.2018 14:17:23, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Don’t. Don’t care. Article is about Spectre.<br>
23.07.2018 14:17:42, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Spectre was my only focus<br>
23.07.2018 14:17:58, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Im telling you regarding Augur cause you brought it up. They are a diffierent animal to “whale club”.<br>
23.07.2018 14:18:20, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Anyway i need to get into a team meet. Ive let the guys know re payment (apparently its already sitting with the guy)<br>
23.07.2018 14:18:34, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Awesome! They can shoot that over?<br>
23.07.2018 14:19:04, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Btw you’re dead wrong on Augur <a href="http://bitcoinhivemind.com/blog/case-against-augur/">http://bitcoinhivemind.com/blog/case-against-augur/</a><br>
23.07.2018 14:19:36, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: dead wrongin which bit<br>
23.07.2018 14:19:55, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: On the bit where you gave two companies hours of your time this morning<br>
23.07.2018 14:20:08, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I dont follow<br>
23.07.2018 14:20:12, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Are you pro or anti augur?<br>
23.07.2018 14:20:32, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: When we could’ve been talking about future plans to actually collaborate so that my brand can be used effectively to assist with your overall mission.<br>
23.07.2018 14:20:52, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Fuck Augur lol. You work on Spectre man. This is a waste of your time. Trust me.<br>
23.07.2018 14:21:16, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Whaleclub is 100% B-book. Augur is nearly 100% on-chain decentralised private liquidity and p2p (micro).<br>
23.07.2018 14:21:22, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I am no fan of Augur btw… lol<br>
23.07.2018 14:21:36, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: And I am no fan of Whale club  - they might both be legit projects thats for the masses to decide.<br>
23.07.2018 14:22:04, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Augur has a massive cash balance, hence their market cap, 3 years out they are just out of beta.<br>
23.07.2018 14:22:15, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Whaleclub, DYOR buddy, we’ve done ours.<br>
23.07.2018 14:22:52, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Not sure why im “dead wrong” on augur, im just stating that we don’t like to be put into abucket with any other broker unless its Oanda. As they are the most legit.<br>
23.07.2018 14:23:09, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Lol you don’t get it<br>
23.07.2018 14:23:38, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You’re arguing with me about two projects that you don’t manage or run<br>
23.07.2018 14:23:45, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: There’s no victory here.<br>
23.07.2018 14:23:55, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: This isnt about victory.<br>
23.07.2018 14:23:57, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Your victory is in focusing on Spectre &amp; moving forward<br>
23.07.2018 14:24:37, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Anyway, can you confirm with who ever is manning this tomorrow when payment is received and article is out.<br>
23.07.2018 14:25:53, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Tomorrow?<br>
23.07.2018 14:25:57, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Why can’t they send it now?<br>
23.07.2018 14:26:13, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Its 7:26pm  here, they left<br>
23.07.2018 14:26:32, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: What time tomorrow will I receive it? I would like a time.<br>
23.07.2018 14:26:59, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: At some point tomorrow. I don’t know as they have typically 5-10 payments to make daily.<br>
23.07.2018 14:27:15, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: At some point?<br>
23.07.2018 14:28:44, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Correct.<br>
23.07.2018 14:28:57, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Should be within 12 hours. That’s fair<br>
23.07.2018 14:29:14, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It’s a 30 second task to copy &amp; paste that address and for them to send it.<br>
23.07.2018 14:29:26, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: He gets into work at 9am or so, that is around 13.5r hours away<br>
23.07.2018 14:29:35, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: So it wontbe 12 hours. Probably 24 hours or so.<br>
23.07.2018 14:29:44, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: 24 hours is ridiculous.<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:03, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: I’ll try this again<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:08, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Its 7:30pm now in the evening<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:13, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: + 12 hours means that person is still at home<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:16, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I’ll try this again.<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:19, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: When they get to work, they start making payments<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:24, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I wrote something. I get paid.<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:25, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: What about that is not clear please?<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:34, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: What about what I said isn’t clear? Are you stupid?<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:48, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Now you’re pissing me off squirt. You don’t call shots on me.<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:49, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We have stated you get paid in 24 hours.<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:56, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I have stated it’s within 112.<br>
23.07.2018 14:30:56, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: We do and we just did.<br>
23.07.2018 14:31:03, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I do. And I just did.<br>
23.07.2018 14:31:05, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Its not going to happen.<br>
23.07.2018 14:31:20, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Then I’m blasting this shit project. Go ahead and get mad and call it a threat.<br>
23.07.2018 14:31:23, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Here is how it works, if you want to get paid, you will respect our payments cycle. We are not saying 24 days, its 24 hours.<br>
23.07.2018 14:31:27, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I could give a fuck.<br>
23.07.2018 14:31:41, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: If you want to have a good reputation you won’t try to ever twist my arm and disrespect me again.<br>
23.07.2018 14:31:57, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Screenshot it.<br>
23.07.2018 14:31:59, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Absolutely. Previous trolls like you have attempted to deface us (mostly brokers), we have all the screenshots and threats and abuse. Happy to escalate.<br>
23.07.2018 14:32:06, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: I do too. I’m happy to escalate too<br>
23.07.2018 14:32:16, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Threat noted Pete, thanks.<br>
23.07.2018 14:32:24, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Lack of payment noted, thanks.<br>
23.07.2018 14:32:31, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Clear scam. Avoidance of paying me. Theft and fraud.<br>
23.07.2018 14:32:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Bullshit excuse to wait and stall so you can run off<br>
23.07.2018 14:33:28, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Sorry you feel that way, ultimately, we will let legal decide on this. If 24 hours is considered ‘running away’ (given its nearing late evening here), then clearly the masses can see who is in the red here.<br>
23.07.2018 14:33:38, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: It is.<br>
23.07.2018 14:33:42, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: They’ll see your statements.<br>
23.07.2018 14:33:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Let’s go to war about it though.<br>
23.07.2018 14:34:25, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Well we wish no war on anyone. Crazy people however, we genuinely believe it is better they are exposed. Any sane person with a basic education reading our convo and your threats and emotional issues can read through it.<br>
23.07.2018 14:34:33, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Good luck Peter.<br>
23.07.2018 14:34:44, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: {{FWD: Spectre [@spectremanagement], 23.07.2018 12:28:34}}<br>
We do not wish our brand to be tarnished by an unregulated company that is clearly hijacking that term in order to drive traffic to their high leverage trading paltform<br>
23.07.2018 14:34:58, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You snapped. Several times. You represent this brand.<br>
23.07.2018 14:35:11, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: 2. I’m not a coin or project people invest in. All my content is free<br>
23.07.2018 14:35:18, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: You are a paid shill.<br>
23.07.2018 14:35:20, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: 3. You didn’t pay me.<br>
23.07.2018 14:35:24, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: And it is clear from this convo.<br>
23.07.2018 14:35:27, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Screenshot<br>
23.07.2018 14:35:29, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Thanks.<br>

23.07.2018 14:37:49, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Thanks for the threats of defamation, extortion. Legal will be reaching out to you shortly. We can see you did this to Bitcore as well FYI. So there is a commonality here.<br>
23.07.2018 14:38:01, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Your project is dead.<br>
23.07.2018 14:38:03, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Bye bye.<br>

23.07.2018 14:38:40, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: Think<br>
23.07.2018 14:38:42, Spectre [@spectremanagement]: Good thing we know how you operate by now.<br>
23.07.2018 14:38:46, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: You have no volume<br>
23.07.2018 14:38:49, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: No one knows you<br>
23.07.2018 14:38:55, Pete Mercury <a href="you">@PeteMercury</a>: And only what I say is out there. Hmm.<br>
