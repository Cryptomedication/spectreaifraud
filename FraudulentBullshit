<p>I’ve spoke about this in days past, and now it is finally out!</p>
<p>Lo and Behold the Volatility RSI ; Here’s the TradingView link:  <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/script/zQ1dkZQz-CryptoMedication-s-Volatility-RSI/">https://www.tradingview.com/script/zQ1dkZQz-CryptoMedication-s-Volatility-RSI/</a></p>

<p>Conversations between my developer and I on the next indicator that we are in the process of formulating.</p>
<h4 id="so-here’s-what-we-ended-up-doing-for-the-most-recent-one-that-we-created.">So, here’s what we ended up doing for the most recent one that we created.</h4>
<ol>
<li>We took the ATR (Average True Range) — You can read about that here:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Then applied the Bollinger Bands %B to it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then overlayed it with another indicator</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Purpose: The general purpose of this indicator is to identify when there are periods of consolidation or if there were be a large increase in the price (going either way). However, we were able to plug this in so that it connected with the RSI (after cancelling out the noise and smoothing values*making it scaled out evenly), so that it also produces buy/sell signals.</p>
<p>So, let me give you some examples, because that might not have appeared to be English above ^</p>
<p>(script is not released yet — coming later today)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*jwz3fJ1ndDWpapmLDEmYMA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The blue range defines the ‘acceptable’ or ‘normalized volatility’ — So, this is no different than RSI in the way that you calculate those boundaries.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*m03X4c2g5Q35rZN0oPmY6w.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When the indicator reaches the point you saw in the picture above, that means that the price has undergone HEAVY consolidation.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*juKb97Urg-VR18k3gcrOuA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Based on this, we’re afforded an opportunity at an early entry. You’d read this increase as divergence in the same way that you’d read it out of RSI.</p>
<p>Now — naturally, you may ask yourself, “How do I know that this increase in volatility means the price direction is going upward?”</p>
<p>Now, normally I would say that you should consult the RSI (and you should when in doubt).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*BmXQ1e5TqsOnhJrcGYvaeg.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you did, we’d see that it was in the oversold range with some divergence. Reasonable to expect a jump in price with that volatility increase.</p>
<p>However, that’s not good enough for us — we wanted it to be even easier to be used correctly.</p>
<p>So, we added in a ‘make it easy for me’ feature on the indicator.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*kIp4LSp9dm2I46XHKuSDYA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You just go to the script settings and then check this box (we’ll go over the other settings in just a moment)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1250/1*szYaZ6rcuaQh5UF2NYjLJQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then voila!</p>
<p>The blue = entries/ red = exit points.</p>
<p>Backtested, tried and true. Fairly tight. Not necessarily leading enough to make a straight anticipation. But definitely one hell of an indicator to add to the numerous other ones that you may be using. This is definitely something that I plan on keeping in my repertoire.</p>
<p>Another thing that I like is the plethora of options that we coded in here — let me go back to that control panel for just a moment.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>“Plot Standard BB%B?” &lt;- This will simply give you the option to plot the normal line BB%B line along with the regular line that you see on the chart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Smooth On?” — If you check this box, it will automatically smooth the line for you by applying an EMA indicator on top of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Smooth BB%B With Xx EMA” — You can select the period of smoothing that you’d like to use for the underlying BB%B basis indicator that we attached to the ATR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“BB%B Multiplier” — You can select the ‘multiplier’ that you’d like to apply to this line (i.e., this is somewhat similar to standard deviation when it comes to charting — if you’re a bit unsure of this feature or how it works, going with 1 /default will be perfectly fine)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“ATR Period” — If you want to make the reading tighter or more accurate. A general rule of thumb when it comes to indicators is this ; the smaller the period, the tighter the reading and the more signals produced. However, this, at times, leads to false positives. Yet, the LONGER the periods, the greater accuracy that you have in the reading. But there will be less frequent readings, resulting in missed opportunities and late entries/exits.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s just a facet of charting and indicators that you can’t get around.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>“What is all this? I want it easy!” — We explained this above already.</li>
</ol>
<p>Andddddd</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>“Chart Period” — Self explanatory.</li>
</ol>
<p>So that covers this indicator here, in specific. It will be up later today under another name than what you see here (that’s just the default/code name that we’re using for the time being).</p>
